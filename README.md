# The Graph Mining Library

This project includes some of Google's Graph Mining tools, namely in-memory
clustering. Our tools can be used for solving data mining and machine learning
problems that either inherently have a graph structure or can be formalized as
graph problems.

For questions/comments, please create an issue on this repository.

## Quickstart

1. Install [Bazel](https://bazel.build/)
2. Run the example: `bazel run //examples:quickstart`
