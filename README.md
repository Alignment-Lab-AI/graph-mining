# The Graph Mining Library (go/gm-third-party)

This directory contains code for graph construction, mining and clustering.
At the moment, it is duplicating some of the internal Graph Mining tools located
at google3/research/graph/. Eventually, the code in this directory will be open
sourced and replace the code in the internal directory.
go/graph-mining for detailed explanations of algorithms.

For questions/comments, contact graph-mining-core@.
