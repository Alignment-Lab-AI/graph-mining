# The Graph Mining Library

This directory contains code for graph construction, mining and clustering.
At the moment, it is duplicating some of the internal Graph Mining tools located
at google3/research/graph/. Eventually, the code in this directory will be open
sourced and replace the code in the internal directory.
go/graph-mining for detailed explanations of algorithms.

For questions/comments, please create an issue on this repository.
