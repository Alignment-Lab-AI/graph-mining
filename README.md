# The Graph Mining Library

This project includes some of Google's Graph Mining tools such as Graph Builder
and Clustering. Our tools can be used for solving data mining and machine
learning problems that either inherently have a graph structure or they can be
formalized as graph problems. Our algorithms and systems are used in a wide
array of Google products such as Search, YouTube, AdWords, Play, Maps, and
Social.
